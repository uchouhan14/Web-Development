  <h1>Hello World</h1>

  <hr>

  <h2>This document is a part of my HTML Revision Course.</h2>
  <p>
    This is my first web page. Just for making my life easier, I'm filling
    Lorem Ipsum text, Everywhere
  </p>

  <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
  <p>
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
      1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
      make a type specimen book.
    </li>
    <li>
      It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
      electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged....
    </li>
    <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML </abbr>
  </ol>

  <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
        <i></i>t has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45
        BC, making it over 2000 years old. <em>really need a getaway</em>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        I live in <abbr title="Delhi">DEL</abbr> and would like to visit a
        beach.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>I have heard a lot of good things about this.</p>
      <address>
        9-Floor<br>Random Tower, New Delhi <br>
        110000
      </address>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- TODO: Change the address someday.-->
  <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>North Pole</dt>
    <dd>I hear this is <strong>cold!</strong></dd>

    <dt>South Pole</dt>
    <dd>This is also <strong>cold!</strong></dd>

    <dt>Mountain Tops</dt>
    <dd>These are also <em>cold.</em></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below
    for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus
    Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original
    form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
    Rackham.

  <h3>Where can I get some?</h3>
  <p>
    There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
    majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
    randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
    going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
    anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
    generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,
    making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary
    of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
    structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
    <strong>The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,
      injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</strong>
